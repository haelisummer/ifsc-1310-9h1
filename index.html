  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Reading about progressive enhancement helped me realize how important it is to focus on the content of you page more. Although the design stands out, progressive enhancement ensures that all users get a comfortable feel from the content given. The Peanut M & M example gave me a deeper understanding. Especially considering I'm one of those who like that kind of M & M particularly because of the peanut in the inside itself, which was used to represent the content of a site. Helping me understand if it were me the content of the site would matter over the design of it. The design would draw me in but it would be what is stated in the content that keeps me drawn in. </p>

  <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
  <p>Throughout this semester I struggled many times. When time came to do assignments I would get extremely nervous because I doubted I could commplete them. This final project terrified me. I started days later than I should've, and I didn't think I would complete it. I began telling family members I would fail Web Technologies because of the final project. I finally stepped out and got a one-on-one tutor session that helped me find my inner skills. The session took less than and hour, I belive, and I was able to start doing code on my own and just had someone watching over my work and point out flaws. I was so excited when I completed my first attempt. After getting feedback I noticed things that didn't look appealing to me , so I knew these feelings would be mutual from other viewers. Going back and making changes wasn't nearly as hard as I expected. I over thought the entire project, honestly every assignment we were assigned I over thought and had no faith in myself. This final project brought back that faith !</p>
